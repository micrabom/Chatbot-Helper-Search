# Save Long-Term Memory
This demo explores how to extract long-term memories from a conversation using a sophisticated agentic workflow.

You can [watch a walkthrough on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Ec3e0dvPXE4)

# Project Setup
You will need to create a .env file with your own keys. I have provided an example at .env.example

The demo files can all be run as Jupyter notebooks.

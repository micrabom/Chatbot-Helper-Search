# Self-Improving Prompt Engineer Agent
This demo explores how to build an agent that can iterate on a prompt, evaluate its results, and use those learnings to make further improvements.

You can [watch a walkthrough on YouTube](https://youtu.be/6Q8xeQLqRE8)

# Project Setup
You will need to create a .env file with your own keys. I have provided an example at .env.example

The demo files can mostly be run through the main Jupyter notebook.

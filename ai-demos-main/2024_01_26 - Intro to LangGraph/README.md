# Intro to LangGraph Agent Workflows
This demo explores using LangGraph to build agents.

It is introductory content - we build up frmo the basics of how a manual conversation works between a user and OpenAI, then add in how tools work, then move up to using a LangChain agent, then finally build two different agents using LangGraph.

Part 1: Running a manual conversation with OpenAI Tools (01_OpenAI_manual_agent.ipynb)  
Part 2: Running a manual conversation with OpenAI plus Tools (01_OpenAI_manual_agent.ipynb)  
Part 3: Building a LangChain Agent to automate that process (02_LangChain_agent.ipynb)  
Part 4: Rebuilding the LangChain Agent with LangGraph (03_LangGraph_agent.ipynb)  
Part 5: Building a LangGraph agent from scratch that accesses a vector database and writes LangChain code (04_LangGraph_develompent_team.ipynb)

# Project Setup
You will need to create a .env file with your own keys. I have provided an example at .env.example

The demo files can all be run as Jupyter notebooks.
